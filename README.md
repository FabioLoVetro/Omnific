# OMnific API

## OMnific API using TDD and C#

As part of the Tech Returners training programme, we utiliised the skills of Test Driven Development and C# for the OMnific API project. Our current team members are Paz, Fabio, Varsha and Pali.

The extension of this project - OMnific Social Media Application - is an application that can be used by teens to submit their Fantasy Animal idea where users can submit their art work of that fantasy animal. It can used to run art competitions in schools where other users can vote on the art. The art work then can be created as an NFT on the ethereum blockchain where those NFTs can be brought, sold and collected.

## Setting the Scene

Working in an Engineering Squad for OMnific, we are tasked with designing software that allows users to submit their Fantasy Animal ideas through an API.

## Project Brief

To create an API end point which uses the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE verbs allowing data to be stored, retrieved and updated from a database.

## Project Setup

The solution has 2 projects. The main implementation is separated into model, controller and services. The test project has been split into fantasy animal, fantasy controller and user tests.

It uses the MySQL database to store data locally and a cloud instance of the database has been created on aws.

## Project Development

The project allowed us to develop the API where requests were sent to the controller and then being dispatched to the appriorpriate service. This was integrated to the MySQL database. There is a coverage of over 65 tests currently. 

## Updates To Implement

* UI Interface to connect through the API and database.
* Continuous integration pipeline to automate the build and run tests.
* To deploy the API on aws.

## Future Development & Learning

* Having an automated pipeline allowing features of the application to be deployed efficiently.
* A design of the application which meets real user cases.
* Understanding NFTs and ethereum blockchain technology.
* Choosing the correct tech (database, languages) for our system.

If you would like to contribute to the extension of this project and can help us we would love to hear from you.
